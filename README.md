# Spam Email Classification with Machine Learning
Welcome to the Spam Email Classification project! üöÄ This project uses machine learning to automatically classify emails as Spam or Not Spam. With a blend of data exploration, text preprocessing, model training, and deployment via a web application, this repository showcases the entire pipeline for solving a common NLP problem.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned ML enthusiast, this project will give you hands-on experience with data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and building an interactive web application using Streamlit. üíª‚ú®

## üîç Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end solution for spam email detection. It leverages the following:

- Data Exploration: Insightful visualizations to understand the dataset.
- Text Preprocessing: Techniques to clean and prepare the data for model training.
- Feature Engineering: Use of TF-IDF for text vectorization.
- Modeling: Training a Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or not.
- Handling Imbalanced Data: Using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to find the best model parameters.
- Real-time Prediction: An interactive Streamlit app to predict spam emails on the go!


## üõ† Key Features
- Data Exploration & Visualization:
1. Analyze the distribution of spam vs. non-spam emails.
2. Explore text length distribution and identify key patterns.
3. Visualize frequent words in both spam and non-spam emails using WordCloud.

- Text Preprocessing & Feature Extraction:

Clean email text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and more.
Use TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features for modeling.
Handling Class Imbalance:

Address class imbalance with SMOTE to enhance model performance on minority classes.
Model Training & Evaluation:

Train a Naive Bayes Classifier and evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and advanced evaluation metrics.
Visualize model performance with ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the model using GridSearchCV to achieve optimal results.
Interactive Web App:

Predict whether a given email is spam or not via a simple Streamlit interface.
Save and view your prediction history in real-time.
üöÄ How to Run the Project Locally

üßë‚Äçüíª Model Training & Evaluation
Model Used:
Naive Bayes Classifier: A simple yet effective model for text classification tasks, especially for spam detection.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Measure of overall prediction correctness.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
ROC Curve: Plot the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate.
Precision-Recall Curve: Plot showing precision vs. recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning:
We perform cross-validation to validate model performance across different data splits.
GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal parameters.
